# roleplay
#### This project is not complete, and as such, some features may not be completely functional at the moment!
A simple roleplay gamemode for RAGE:MP. This project uses Node.js, SQL, and the RAGE:MP API to create a gamemode in which players interact with each other while acting as a fictional character in a parallel universe. 

The server uses MrPancakers2's RAGE Accounts resource (https://github.com/RageMpOpenSource/RAGE-Accounts) for handling accounts and logins along with the initial database schema.
